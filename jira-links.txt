how to work with jira (atlassian):

__1__ An issue should be related to a single problem - "dashboard is loaded slowly and graph shows wrong data" is bad, split this to 2 issues.

__2__ List clear steps to reproduce - including version, specific data that was loaded (pcaps or DB), what steps were done exactly and screenshots.

__3__ Proper issue type - if you have a suggestion for an improvement, it is not a bug, it is likely to be an initiative.

__4__ Clear title, that allows to easily understand the problem / suggestion

__5__ Use keywords, don't use abbreviations - makes it easier to locate issues, if there is a keyword that you think can help, but you couldn't add it to the text - add "keywords: xxx, yyy, zzz" in the end of the issue.

	if you write "MB" instead of "modbus", it will be hard to locate this issue in the future.

__7__ Use JIRA's formatting
	* {{}} for code oneliners, or {code}...{code} for code blocks, if possible also include syntax highlighting
	* Use headers (for example, for steps to reproduce)
	* Use numbered lists

__9__ Make sure that your issue looks like you meant after you have opened it - no broken links, screenshots appear, text is clear and understandable.
