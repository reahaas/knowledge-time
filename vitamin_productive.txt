1. work less hours:
   start at 09:00 (wakeup at 08:40)
   end at 18:00
   * summary day every day.
   
2. distraction reduction.

3. what had I automated today?

4. talk to the mentor every day.
   mentor can change per week/month
   
5. smaller tasks - each day should end with a PR.
   and if the task is not small enough, break it even more for the next day.
   
6. 



issues:

1. How to break PR into smaller peacies? refactor vs bug fix vs new functionality.
